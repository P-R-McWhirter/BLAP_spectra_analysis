# BLAP_spectra_analysis

A set of Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of the equivalent widths of BLAP spectra from the SPRAT spectrograph on the Liverpool Telescope. Uses packages like PHEW (PytHon Equivalent Widths) and SpectRes.

Work in progress to see if a publication is possible but the R=300 is current limiting the process!

Reduced spectra included in numpy datafiles. The original .fits files can be obtained from the Liverpool Telescope archive using the proposal ID JL18A12.
